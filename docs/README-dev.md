# US Immigration

## The Project

The goal of the US Immigration data visualizer is to show the flow of
immigrants to the United States by decade since 1820. The data used was
sourced from the US census.

The project must be completed in 4 days.

### Technologies
* d3.js - A javascript library for manipulating document with data.
* mapbox API - A location data platform designed specifically to build rich
maps.
* Vanilla javascript
* Webpack for bundling the scripts

## MVP

Coordinates between countries will render a series of dots representing
a rate of 25,000 immigrants per dot flow on a path towards the US.  
The more immigrants, the higher the speed of
the dots. Countries with a larger number will
have a noticeably higher rate.

Users will have an interactive experience by using the mouse to scroll
which decade the user wants to see with rate changing depending on the data.
